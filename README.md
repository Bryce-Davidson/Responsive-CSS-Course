# Responsive CSS

- Don't use pixels for width or height
- Relative units `em` and `rem`
- Using `max-width`
- Discovering `vh, vw, vmax, vmin`

## Principles

Use as many relative units as possible.
Make sure that you are using the relative unit needed to epxress the size of the content relative to what you want.
